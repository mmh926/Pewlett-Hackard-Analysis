# 1.	Overview of the analysis:

  o	The purpose of the new analysis is to determine the number of retiring employees per title and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

# 2.	Results:

  The four major points from the two analysis deliverables, were:

  1.	A query was written and executed to create a Retirement Titles table for employees who are born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955 and the Retirement Titles table was exported as a csv file.

  2.	A query was written and executed to create a Unique Titles table that contains the employee number, first and last name, and most recent title, then I exported the table to a Unique Titles csv file.

  1.	According to the below chart, which shows the number of employees by their most recent job title who are about to retire, seven distinct roles (job titles) will need to be filled.

  o	In summary, seven roles will need to be filled as a result of the upcoming “Silver Tsunami”, totaling up to 90,398 positions. However, on the positive side, there are 1,549 rows of retirement-ready employees in departments who may mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees so valuable knowledge and skills may be transferred. 

  o	Furthermore, the below queries may provide additional insight into both the Sales department and the Development department and how the upcoming “Silver Tsunami” may adversely affect them with a large number of attrition.
